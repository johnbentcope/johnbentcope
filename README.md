# Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I am an enthusiastic tinkerer and developer of embedded systems, looking for a role allowing me to exercise my skills and passions while designing and implementing the technology of tomorrow. My **Bachelor of Science** in **Computer Engineering** from the **University of Central Florida** followed the **VLSI** track, and electives highlighted **FPGA**, **microcontrollers** **electronics**, **filtering**, and **system security**. My long term goals include professional engineering licensing.

## Projects
My GitHub contains past work in Java, C, and Verilog, as well as my KiCAD projects and libraries and a handful of assignments from my undergraduate career.

## Senior Design
The repo containing my senior design project contains many forms of content. The repository was used to synchronize work across the four person team, and resulted in our ability to design, build, and pilot an ROV in the 7 month span of our capstone engineering project. My contributions to these systems include PCB development in KiCAD, and virtual telepresence using an Oculus Rift.

## Processing
My repo by this name contains the Java and Processing source code to many of my visualization and animation explorations.
